          <h1>SnippetDrop Terms of Service</h1>
          <p>Thank you for using SnippetDrop!</p>
          <p>When we say ”company”, “we”, “our”, “us”, ”service” or ”services” in this document, we are referring to
            SnippetDrop.</p>
          <p><strong>Note</strong>: The following Terms of Service applies to SnippetDrop's server/API that is
            integrated with the open-source SnippetDrop VS Code extension project.</p>
          <p>We may update these Terms of Service in the future. Whenever we make a significant change to our policies,
            we
            will also announce them via email.</p>
          <p>When you use our service, now or in the future, you are agreeing to the latest Terms of Service. That’s
            true for
            any of our existing and future products and all features that we add to our service over time. There may be
            times
            where we do not exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Service; in doing so, we are not
            waiving that right or provision. These terms do contain a limitation of our liability.</p>
          <p>If you do not agree to these Terms of Service, do not use this service. Violation of any of the terms below
            may
            result in the termination of your account. That’s a broad statement and it means you need to place a lot of
            trust
            in us. We do our best to deserve that trust by being open about how we work and keeping an open door to your
            feedback.</p>
          <h2 id="account-terms">Account terms</h2>
          <p>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and API credentials. SnippetDrop cannot
            and
            will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.</p>
          <p>You are responsible for any activity that occurs under your account.</p>
          <p>You may not use our service for any illegal purpose or to violate any laws in your jurisdiction.</p>
          <p>You must provide your GitHub username and a valid email address in order to complete the signup process.
          </p>
          <p>You must be a human. Accounts registered by bots or other automated methods are not permitted.</p>
          <h2 id="cancellation-and-termination">Cancellation and termination</h2>
          <p>You can request an account deletion by emailing team@snippetdrop.com.</p>
          <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of
            the
            service for any reason at any time.</p>
          <p>Verbal, physical, written or other abuse (including threats of abuse or retribution) of any service
            customer,
            company employee or officer may result in immediate account termination.</p>
          <h2 id="modifications-to-the-service-and-prices">Modifications to the service and prices</h2>
          <p>We reserve the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or
            permanently, any
            part of the service with or without notice.</p>
          <p>Sometimes we change the pricing structure for our products. When we do that, we tend to exempt existing
            customers
            from those changes. However, we may choose to change the prices for existing customers. If we do so, we will
            give
            at least 30 days notice and will notify you via the email address on record. We may also post a notice about
            changes on our blog or the affected services themselves.</p>
          <p>SnippetDrop shall not be liable to you or to any third-party for any modification, price change,
            suspension or discontinuance of the service.</p>
          <h2 id="content-ownership-copyright-and-trademark">Content ownership, copyright and trademark</h2>
          <p>You are solely responsible for any content and other material that you submit, publish, transmit, email, or
            display on, through, or with the service.</p>
          <p>We claim no intellectual property rights over the material you provide to the service. All site data
            remains
            yours.</p>
          <p>You may provide us with feedback, suggestions, and ideas about the service. You agree that we own all
            rights to
            use and incorporate the feedback you provide in any way, including in future enhancements and modifications
            to the
            service, without payment or attribution to you.</p>
          <p>You must not modify another website so as to falsely imply that it is associated with SnippetDrop. The
            look and feel of the service is copyright© to SnippetDrop. All rights reserved. “SnippetDrop”, the
            SnippetDrop logo and any other product or service name or slogan displayed on the service are trademarks
            of the company and may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole or in part, without the prior written
            permission
            of the company or the applicable trademark holder. You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell
            or
            exploit any portion of the service, use of the service, or access to the service without the express written
            permission by the company.</p>
          <h2 id="general-conditions">General conditions</h2>
          <p>Your use of SnippetDrop is at your sole risk. The service is provided on an “as is” and “as available”
            basis. We do take uptime of our application seriously.</p>
          <p>We design our services with care, based on our own experience and the experiences of customers who share
            their
            time and feedback. However, there is no such thing as a service that pleases everybody. We make no
            guarantees that
            our services will meet your specific requirements or expectations.</p>
          <p>We also test all of our features extensively before shipping them. As with any software, our services
            inevitably
            have some bugs. We track the bugs reported to us and work through priority ones, especially any related to
            security or privacy. Not all reported bugs will get fixed and we don’t guarantee completely error-free
            services.
          </p>
          <p>Technical support is provided by email. Email responses are provided on the reasonable effort basis without
            guaranteed response time.</p>
          <h2 id="liability">Liability</h2>
          <p>We mention liability throughout these Terms but to put it all in one section:</p>
          <p>You expressly understand and agree that SnippetDrop shall not be liable, in law or in equity, to you or
            to any third party for any direct, indirect, incidental, lost profits, special, consequential, punitive or
            exemplary damages, including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other
            intangible losses (even if the company has been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from:
            (i)
            the use or the inability to use the services; (ii) the cost of procurement of substitute goods and services
            resulting from any goods, data, information or services purchased or obtained or messages received or
            transactions
            entered into through or from the services; (iii) unauthorized access to or alteration of your transmissions
            or
            data; (iv) statements or conduct of any third party on the service; (v) or any other matter relating to this
            Terms
            of Service or the services, whether as a breach of contract, tort (including negligence whether active or
            passive), or any other theory of liability.</p>
          <p>In other words: choosing to use our services does mean you are making a bet on us. If the bet does not work
            out,
            that’s on you, not us. We do our darnedest to be as safe a bet as possible through careful management of the
            business; investments in security, infrastructure, and talent; and in general giving a damn. If you choose
            to use
            our services, thank you for betting on us.</p>
          <p>This agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Georgia (USA), and the courts of the State of
            Georgia (USA) shall have exclusive
            jurisdiction to hear and determine all issues that may arise under or in relation to this agreement.</p>
          <h2 id="contact-us">Contact us</h2>
          <p>If you have a question about any of the Terms of Service, please email team@snippetdrop.com.</p>
