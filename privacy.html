          <h3>Section&nbsp;3 -&nbsp;Disclosure</h3>
          <p>We may disclose your personal information if we are required by law to do so or if you violate our Terms of
            Service.</p>
          <h3>Section 4 -&nbsp;Third-Party Services</h3>
          <p>In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your information to
            the
            extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us.</p>
          <p>However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction
            processors,
            have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to them for your
            purchase-related
            transactions.</p>
          <p>For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in
            which
            your personal information will be handled by these providers.</p>
          <p>In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located in a
            different
            jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services
            of a third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the
            jurisdiction(s)
            in which that service provider or its facilities are located.</p>
          <p>As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a payment gateway located
            in
            the United States, then your personal information used in completing that transaction may be subject to
            disclosure
            under United States legislation, including the Patriot Act.</p>
          <p>Once you leave our website or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no longer
            governed
            by this Privacy Policy or our website’s Terms of Service.</p>

            etc.)
            are logged (regardless of account status).</p>
          <p>Links</p>
          <p>When you click on links on our website or service, they may direct you away from our site. We are not
            responsible
            for the privacy practices of other sites and encourage you to read their privacy statements.</p>

            make
            sure it is not inappropriately lost, misused, accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed.</p>
          <p>All payment transactions are completed through and stored on Stripe. When submitting a credit card form,
            your
            information is only submitted to Stripe. Our backend services cannot see or access your full payment
            information.

            owners
            so that we may continue to provide services to you.</p>
